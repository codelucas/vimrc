# Lucas's Version of Amix's vimrc

**Installation directions:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codelucas/vimrc ~/.vim_runtime
    sh ~/.vim_runtime/install.sh
```

**Note:** If you are using OSX and your colors are screwed up,
it's due to some terminal configuration thing.

Open up either of the `.terminal` theme files in the **osx-pallets** 
afolder provided and run it. Then open terminal preferences. 
`Solarized Dark` should be a profile option. Select it and set as 
default. Make sure terminals are declared as **xterm-256color**.

I will add more changes later but for now the biggest reason
this was forked was because I want `solarized dark` to be auto
installed without any hassle. 

Also, i'm not super into any of the fancy plugins, but Amix's 
basic setup was **amazing**.

This version installs pathogen for the solarized theme.

If anything still is broken, refer to [osx-solarized](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized) or
