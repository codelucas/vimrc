# Lucas's Version of Amix's vimrc

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codelucas/vimrc ~/.vim_runtime
    sh ~/.vim_runtime/install.sh
```

I will add more changes later but for now the biggest reason
this was forked was because I want `solarized dark` to be auto
installed without any hassle. 

Also, i'm not super into any of the fancy plugins, but Amix's 
basic setup was **amazing**.

This version installs pathogen for the solarized theme.
